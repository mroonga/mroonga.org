## Mroonga 12.07 has been released!

Mroonga is a MySQL storage engine that supports fast fulltext search
and geolocation search. It is CJK ready. It uses Groonga as a storage
and fulltext search engine.

[Mroonga 12.07](/docs/news.html#release-12-07) has been released!

* How to install: [Install](/docs/install.html)
* How to upgrade: [Upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade.html)

### Changes

The main changes are as follows.

### Improvements


* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for MariaDB 10.3.36, 10.4.26, 10.5.17, 10.6.9, 10.7.5 and 10.8.4.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 5.7.39-42.

* [CentOS](/docs/install/centos.html), [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Added support for Percona Server 8.0.29-21.

  MySQL 8.0.29 used by Percona Server 8.0.29 has a critical issue. So we do not recommend to use this version.
     
  See [MySQL 8.0.29 Release Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-29.html) for details about the issue.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug to fail to install or upgrade Mroonga with install.sql.
  
  Broken install.sql caused this bug. This bug had occurred since Mroonga 12.06.

* Fixed a bug that `mroonga_command()` returns results with hex dump for MySQL 8.0 and above.

  `mroonga_command()` returns results with a correct character code form this version.

* [AlmaLinux](/docs/install/almalinux.html) Fixed an installation document for Mroonga on AlmaLinux 8.
